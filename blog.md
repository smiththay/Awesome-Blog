#### Week One- The One About Git

I came in with expectations to struggle and Awesome Inc. most certainly went above and beyond. Coming from a background unrelated to tech, I felt I was behind the 8 ball. Everything was new. The good news is that you can’t become great by taking the easy route. The expectation of 15-20 hours a week was not so true for me, as I put in extra hours to understand *Terminal*, *VS Code*, *Git*, and *Github*.

So what am I struggling with? The answer is **YES**. As I said, everything is new. So like learning to ride a bike, you’re going to get a lot of scrapes and bruises. I first struggled with the concepts of terminal, git, and GitHub. Then I struggled with how to be technical with them as I tried to see how they all interfaced. Started to get some traction to only be derailed again when starting the blog. As I am working on this blog, I am solidifying many of the concepts and processes that I had learned throughout the week. 


This whole journey is exciting. Im eager and optimistic to learn more as I progress in the program. Currently, Im excited to have git and Github down so well that I can look back at this blog and laugh at the way I struggled. I can’t wait to fail next week

#### Week Two- The One About HTML

*Sigh of relief...*

Some thing seems familiar for the first time in bootcamp, albeit it has been many years since I have really messed with it. HTML, I believe most people have had to mess with it in a computer science class in highschool. It wasn't as difficult to get back in it compared to last week learning completely new topics. We worked on a *Markup Letter*, *Structure a Page of Content*, and our demo day project, *Layout a Splash Page*. 

I struggled with less this week but that doesn't mean I didn't struggle at all. Along side HTML, we also dove in on CSS. There were many new elements in HTML that I discovered, and everything in CSS was new. All the projects didn't require too much CSS knowledge so I didn't have to worry all that much about learning CSS syntax. I struggled a bit with the resizing the panda picture in the splash page project. As many of the struggles I had, it was a small detail.

Im eager to learn more about CSS. I want to flex my creative side some more and being good at CSS will definitely help with that.
