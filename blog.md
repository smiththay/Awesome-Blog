#### Week One- The One About Git

I came in with expectations to struggle and Awesome Inc. most certainly went above and beyond. Coming from a background unrelated to tech, I felt I was behind the 8 ball. Everything was new. The good news is that you can’t become great by taking the easy route. The expectation of 15-20 hours a week was not so true for me, as I put in extra hours to understand *Terminal*, *VS Code*, *Git*, and *Github*.

So what am I struggling with? The answer is **YES**. As I said, everything is new. So like learning to ride a bike, you’re going to get a lot of scrapes and bruises. I first struggled with the concepts of terminal, git, and GitHub. Then I struggled with how to be technical with them as I tried to see how they all interfaced. Started to get some traction to only be derailed again when starting the blog. As I am working on this blog, I am solidifying many of the concepts and processes that I had learned throughout the week. 


This whole journey is exciting. Im eager and optimistic to learn more as I progress in the program. Currently, Im excited to have git and Github down so well that I can look back at this blog and laugh at the way I struggled. I can’t wait to fail next week
